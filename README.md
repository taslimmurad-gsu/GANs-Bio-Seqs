# Exploring The Potential Of GANs In Biological Sequence Analysis
This repository is for the paper ``Exploring The Potential Of GANs In Biological Sequence Analysis``

https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02421

The GAN-based bio-sequences creation code is given in Code/GANs-Sequence-Creation.py file.
the Code/t-SNE.py file contains code to get the t-SNE visualization of the given sequences based on their respectve target labels.

All the plots used in the paper are given in ``Figures`` folder
